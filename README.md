## Reflections

This was the first project for the RED Academy Full-Time Web Developer Program. It incorporates modern markup and styling techniques that were key to our learning in the rest of the program.

Looking back, I'm happy with how I was able to stay organized and logical throughout my code, even though we hadn't used things like SASS yet.
